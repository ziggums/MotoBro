# MotoBro
Ziggums' pet project

Welcome to MotoBro, the experiment for localized, weather-determined ride / dont ride for motorcyclists! Designed with a commuter in mind, it is meant to provide a notification pre-commute to let a rider know if the weather will be good enough for a motorcycle commute.

This is my first project as a self-taught developer, so I am making this publicly available to those who wish to view, comment, or even possibly help me with this idea! Do not hesitate to contact me with any comments or questions!
