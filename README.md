# MotoBro
Houston's pet project

Welcome to MotoBro, the experiment for localized, weather-determined ride / dont ride for motorcyclists! Designed with a commuter in mind, it is meant to provide a notification pre-commute to let a rider know if the weather will be good enough for a motorcycle commute.
